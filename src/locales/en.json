        "definition": "A {decision_tree} is a predictive model that represents a series of decisions structured in tree form, where each {internal_node} corresponds to a question or condition based on data characteristics, and each {branch} leads to a possible answer or division. The {leaves} of the tree indicate the final result, such as a class or numerical value. This model is widely used in {classification} and {regression} tasks due to its intuitive interpretation: it simulates a sequential decision-making process, where we follow a logical path based on inputs until reaching a conclusion.",

        "description": "During the {prediction} process, the decision tree receives a new input (or sample) and traverses it from {root_to_leaf}, following the conditions defined at each decision point. At each step, it analyzes the value of a {feature} from the input and chooses the {corresponding_branch} based on the condition (for example, whether the value is less than or greater than a certain threshold). This path is {unique} and leads directly to a {leaf}, where the predicted class (in classifiers) or a numerical value (in regression models) is recorded. The process is {fast_interpretable}, functioning as a logical sequence of decisions that culminates in a final conclusion.",
